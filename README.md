<!-- > [!NOTE] -->
> <img src="img/note.png" height="24"/><br>
> If the texture pack doesn't load when starting the game, make sure to delete the `gfx.*.raw` files from the `res` directory or set the `Display -> Texture Caching` option to `At Startup`.

<details>
<summary><h3>Character Select</h3></summary>

Original idea by [Squishy](https://github.com/Squishy6094), for **sm64coopdx**: [Character Select](https://github.com/Squishy6094/character-select-coop)<br>
Character Select mods are available on the [sm64coopdx modsite](https://mods.sm64coopdx.com/mods/categories/character-select.14/).

Now partially supported by *Odyssey Mario's Moveset*, each individual character of Character Select mods is turned into a playable model pack, featuring the character's model, caps, palette preset, animations and voice clips!

To use a Character Select mod, download it, then put the downloaded `.zip` file into the `res/packs` directory of the game.<br>Enable it in-game by opening the options menu and selecting `Model Packs`.

<!-- > [!NOTE] -->
> <img src="img/note.png" height="24"/><br>
> **All CS characters work only on Mario**. If you want to use a CS character with Peach, Luigi or Wario, enable the `Mario Mode` in the `Odyssey Mario's Moveset -> Extras` sub-menu.

<!-- > [!IMPORTANT] -->
> <img src="img/important.png" height="24"/><br>
> **Not all packs are compatible**. *Odyssey Mario's Moveset* doesn't interpret Lua, the language used for Character Select mods, but uses a parser that heavily relies on the [Character Select Template](https://github.com/Squishy6094/character-select-coop/raw/main/char-select-template.zip) format.

<!-- > [!WARNING] -->
> <img src="img/warning.png" height="24"/><br>
> Some models may crash the game, due to inconsistencies between **sm64coopdx** rendering engine and *Odyssey Mario's Moveset*'s, notably regarding two-cycle and multitexturing.

<summary><h3>LiveSplit Autosplit</h3></summary>

The LiveSplit Autosplit script for *Odyssey Mario's Moveset* is available [here](https://github.com/PeachyPeachSM64/sm64ex-omm/raw/refs/heads/scripts/omm.asl).<br>

To add it to LiveSplit, right-click, select `Edit Layout...`, click on `(+)`, then `Control`, `Scriptable Auto Splitter`, double click on it, `Browse...` and finally select the file previously downloaded.

*What the script is able to do:*
- Starts when the player selects a file,
- Splits each time a certain amount of stars is collected,
- Stops when the Grand Star is grabbed,
- Resets when the game returns to the main menu.

*How to make it work:*
- Start LiveSplit, load your splits, save them as a file named `splits.lss` and place it next to the game executable.
- Then, start the game, the auto-splits will be generated from the provided `splits.lss` file.

*Splits formatting:*
- For star splits, you must indicate the amount of stars needed in brackets:
  - Use square brackets to split upon star collection: `[20]`.
  - Use parentheses to delay the split until the level exit: `(20)`.
- If a split has `Bowser` in its name but no star amount, it is interpreted as a Bowser key split or a Grand Star split and the split is triggered on key/star collection.
- If the final split has no star amount, it is interpreted as a Grand Star split (i.e. after defeating the last Bowser) and immediately stops the timer.
