# Odyssey Mario's Moveset
**Mod exclusively for the *Super Mario 64 PC Port*, developed by PeachyPeach.**

-----

## Build the game with *OMM Builder*

*OMM Builder* is a convenient Python script that makes the building process of the *Odyssey Mario's Moveset* mod simplier, while allowing some customization.<br>If you have never built the PC port of *Super Mario 64* before, please take a look at this [page](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/wiki/Compiling-on-Windows) or this [page](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/wiki/Compiling-on-Linux) first.<br>Make sure you have the following dependencies before starting: `MSYS2` (Windows only), `git`, `make`, `gcc`, `glew`, `SDL2` and `python3`.

```diff
- IMPORTANT NOTICE:
- Cloning the `sm64ex-omm` repository from PeachyPeachSM64's github is the only way to get the builder.
- Never download or execute the file `omm_builder.py` from any other source, even trusted ones, as it's
- likely to contain malicious code that can irremediably harm your computer or steal your personal data.
```

---

### Installing the builder:

- **Windows**:

  - Open an MSYS2 terminal. To do so, open the **Windows Start** menu, type `mingw` and select `MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit` or `MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit`, depending of your operating system and processor type. To see it, open the **Windows Settings**, go to **System**, and select **About**.

  - The first time, install the builder by cloning the *master* branch with this command:<br>`git clone https://github.com/PeachyPeachSM64/sm64ex-omm.git -b master`

  - Move to the created directory and open it in Windows Explorer by executing the following command:<br>`cd sm64ex-omm; explorer .`

  - If it's not already done, in Windows Explorer, click on the **View** tab, then check **File name extensions**. This option will allow you to rename files properly.

  - Place your copy of the **Super Mario 64 US ROM** inside it, next to the Python script `omm_builder.py`, and rename it `baserom.us.z64`.

- **Linux**:

  - Open a terminal.

  - The first time, install the builder by cloning the *master* branch with this command:<br>`git clone https://github.com/PeachyPeachSM64/sm64ex-omm.git -b master`

  - Move to the created directory by executing the following command:<br>`cd sm64ex-omm`

  - Place your copy of the **Super Mario 64 US ROM** inside it, next to the Python script `omm_builder.py`, and rename it `baserom.us.z64`.

### Building the game:

*OMM Builder* is a command-line tool with four main commands:

||||
|:-|:-|:-|
| Build | Compile the game with the version specified. | `python3 omm_builder.py [version] [build_speed] [args...]` |
| Run | Run the game with the version specified. An executable of the specified version must be compiled first. | `python3 omm_builder.py [version] run` |
| Clear | Clear the build directory of the version specified. | `python3 omm_builder.py [version] clear` |
| Reset | Reset the version directory without deleting it, but remove the compiled game. | `python3 omm_builder.py [version] reset` |
| Delete | Delete the version directory, including all its content. | `python3 omm_builder.py [version] delete` |

The `[version]` parameter must be one of the following:

|||
|:-|:-|
| `smex` | Super Mario 64 ex-nightly |
| `smms` | Super Mario 64 Moonshine |
| `xalo` | Super Mario 64 ex-alo |
| `sm74` | Super Mario 74 |
| `smsr` | Super Mario Star Road |
| `r96a` | Render96 ex-alpha |

The `[build_speed]` parameter must be one of the following:

|||
|:-|:-|
| `slow` | Build the game by compiling files one by one. |
| `fast` | Enable multi-processing to build the game faster. |
| `faster` | Build the game even faster (not recommended for weak PCs). |
| `fastest` | Use 100% of CPU to build the game as fast as possible. |

The `[args...]` parameters can be any of the following:

|||
|:-|:-|
| `DYNOS` | Download and install the latest version of DynOS. |
| `PATCHES` | Apply patches from the 'custom/patches' directory. |
| `DIRECT_X` | Replace SDL/OpenGL APIs by DirectX APIs. |
| `AUTO_RUN` | Start the game after building. |

For instance, if you want to build and play *Star Road* with 60 FPS and External data, run the command:<br>`python3 omm_builder.py smsr faster DIRECT_X AUTO_RUN`<br>Additionally, the builder is case-insensitive, meaning you can also write the previous command as:<br>`python3 omm_builder.py smsr faster directx autorun`

---

### Requirements

- To build *Super Mario 64 Moonshine*, you must extract the mod archive (`MOONSHINE_FINALUPDATE.rar`) into a directory named `moonshine`.

### Custom patches

- To build the game with custom patches, place a copy of your `.patch` files inside the `custom/patches` directory and run the command with the `PATCHES` option.
- Remember that not all patches or combination of patches are supported.

### Texture and sound packs

- Customize your game's textures and sounds by placing your packs `.zip` archives inside the `custom/res` directory.
- Texture packs must be `.zip` archives with a `gfx` directory inside them.
- Sound packs must be `.zip` archives with a `sound` directory inside them.

### Model packs (DynOS and *Render96* only)

- To be able to swap actors models in-game, copy your model packs directories inside the `custom/dynos/packs` directory and run the command with the `DYNOS` option.
- Model packs must be either directories of `.bin` files or filled with actors sub-directories, each sub-directory containing at least one `model.inc.c` and one `geo.inc.c` file as well as textures `.png` files.

### Musics, jingles and sounds (*Render96* only)

- Make your game more unique with custom musics, jingles and sounds! Put your audio data inside a `custom/dynos/audio` directory before running the command.
- *Render96* audio packs must be directories of sub-directories and `.txt` files, with each `.txt` file corresponding to one sub-directory.
- The sub-directories must be: `jingles`, `levels`, `sfx_mario`, `sfx_mario_peach`, `sfx_luigi`, `sfx_luigi_peach`, `sfx_wario`, `sfx_wario_peach`.
- The associated `.txt` files are: `jingle.txt`, `music.txt`, `sfx_mario.txt`, `sfx_mario_peach.txt`, `sfx_luigi.txt`, `sfx_luigi_peach.txt`, `sfx_wario.txt`, `sfx_wario_peach.txt`.

---

## Build the game with *sm64pcBuilder2*

Remember that this tool's only purpose is to build the *Odyssey Mario's Moveset* mod with the most common and useful features. It's not supposed (and will never) be as complete as **sm64pcBuilder2**.

If you want more customization or simply build the game the usual way, you can download the patch file of the latest version of OMM available in the section **Useful resources** below and add it as a custom patch in **sm64pcBuilder2**.

---

## Q&A

### The builder says `ERROR: The file 'baserom.us.z64' is missing.`, but it is here!

Your file is actually named `baserom.us.z64.z64`. It happened because Windows hides file extensions by default, and adds its extension back after renaming a file.<br>To prevent this, in Windows Explorer, click on the **View** tab and check **File name extensions**. Then remove the extra `.z64` from your file name.

### The builder is spitting out errors like `gcc: No such file or directory`. What does it mean?

You're missing dependencies. You need the following ones to properly build the game: `MSYS2` (Windows only), `git`, `make`, `gcc`, `glew`, `SDL2` and `python3`.<br>Go to this [page](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/wiki/Compiling-on-Windows) (Windows) or this [page](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/wiki/Compiling-on-Linux) (Linux) and make sure to follow the **Install dependencies** part.

### The game is built successfully, but the only thing I get when launching it is a black screen with the game over sound...

You probably built the game with a renderer not supported by your computer.<br>Delete your build and try again with the flag `DIRECT_X` to change the SDL/OpenGL API by the DirectX one.

### Where did my executable go? Do I have to always use the `run` command to play the game?

Once built, the game executable is located in the `build/us_pc` directory of the version you choose.<br>You don't need to use the `run` command every time, you can simply double-click on `sm64.us.f3dex2e.exe` like any other executable to start the game.<br>If you want to copy or move it, make sure to copy/move the entire `build/us_pc` directory, not only the executable file.

### Where is the save file located? How do I open/edit it?

Windows: `%appdata%\sm64ex\omm_save_file.txt`<br>Linux: `~/.local/share/sm64ex/omm_save_file.txt`<br>MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/sm64ex/omm_save_file.txt`<br><br>The save file is a plain text file, so any text editor can open it. It is divided in multiple sections:
- `[xxxx:yy]`: The main game save data. `xxxx` is the version name, `yy` is the save slot.
  - Flags: 0 = locked and 1 = unlocked.
  - Courses: the first 7 numbers are the stars (1 = collected, 0 = not), the next number is the cannon (1 = open, 0 = closed) and the last number is the coin score.
- `[sparkly_stars]`: The Sparkly Stars save data. It cannot be edited directly.
- `[mario_colors]`, `[peach_colors]`: The custom palettes for playable characters.
  - Each `mario_custom` (`peach_custom`) entry consists of 6 (7) pairs of RGB values in hexadecimal form.
  - The first value of a pair is the ambient color, the second is the diffuse color.
  - For Mario, the colors are in the following order: *Cap*, *Hair*, *Skin*, *Gloves*, *Overalls*, *Shoes*.
  - For Peach, the colors are in the following order: *Skin*, *Hair*, *Dress (light tone)*, *Dress (dark tone)*, *Gloves*, *Earrings*, *Shoes*.
- `[settings]`: The saved options. It includes controls, shortcuts and extras.

### What is the options menu?

### How do I update *OMM Builder*/*Odyssey Mario's Moveset*?

If it detects a new version, the builder will ask you if you want to update it when you launch it.<br>As for the *Odyssey Mario's Moveset* mod, the files are automatically updated when running a Build command.

---

## Speedrunning

For speedrunners, OMM comes with a LiveSplit auto-splitter.<br>It works with every game that can be built with OMM.

An auto-splitter is a script, a small program, that runs through LiveSplit and does the splits automatically, so the player doesn't need to press a key or a button to trigger each one.<br>What it does in *Super Mario 64* is fairly simple:
- Starts the timer when the player selects a file,
- Splits each time a specific amount of stars is collected,
- Stops when the Grand Star is collected at the end of a run, or when the last split is triggered,
- Resets when the player returns to the main menu.

To install it and make it work, follow these steps:
- Your OMM version must be 6.1.0 or later.
- Open LiveSplit, and load your splits. Make sure they follow this format:
  - For star splits, you must indicate the amount of stars needed in brackets or parentheses like this: "\[20\]" or "(20)".
  - If a split has "Bowser" in its name but no star amount, it will be interpreted as a Bowser key split or a Grand Star split.
  - If the final split has no star amount, it is interpreted as a Grand Star split (i.e. after defeating the last Bowser).
- Right click, select `Save Splits As...` and save them as a `splits.lss` file next to the `sm64.us.f3dex2e.exe` executable.
- Right click again, and select `Edit Layout...`.
- Add a `Scriptable Auto Splitter`, double-click on it, and select `Browse...`.
- Navigate to the OMM builder directory and select the file `omm.asl`.
- Press `OK` twice, then start the game. The timer should start as soon as an **empty** save file is selected.

## Version 7.1.0 (11/04/2022)

### OMM Builder:
- Fixed DynOS compilation on Linux-based systems.
- `r96a` now uses the repository `Render96ex-tester_rt64alpha`.<br>Note 1: You don't need an RTX card to build this branch.<br>Note 2: The new audio system in the `tester` branch is not supported yet.
- Removed options: `60_FPS` and `EXT_DATA`.
- Removed `rt64` and `saex` from compatible versions list.

### Bug fixes:
- Fixed a slowdown with Peach's model.
- Fixed a bug where Mario could long-jump out of a ground Cappy throw, even if he wasn't moving.
- Fixed the weird underwater Cappy throw momentum.
- Fixed a bug where cold water couldn't damage Mario when both Classic moveset and 1 HP mode were enabled.
- Fixed a bug where collecting coins underwater could kill Mario when both Classic moveset and 1 HP mode were enabled.
- Fixed a bug where collecting Castle stars could warp Mario back to the Castle grounds.
- Fixed a crash that could happen when starting a new game with Peach.
- Sparkly Stars:
  - Fixed a bug where Mario could capture Toads through walls with a well-placed Cappy throw.
  - Fixed a bug where Mario could go behind the TTC clock with a well-placed Cappy bounce.
- Star Road:
  - Fixed a wrong warp bug with the yellow pipe in the sewers.
  - Fixed the Grand Star hitbox.
- Render96:
  - Fixed the *Never stop playing as Peach* crash.

### GFX Engine:
- Built-in 60+ FPS patch, allowing to run the game from 30 to 360 FPS.
- Interpolated all HUD stuff, as well as dialog boxes, screen effects and timers.
- Frame interpolation is automatically disabled during states that doesn't need it, like the file select screen or when the game is paused.
- External Data is always enabled.

### OMM Bowser:
- Enraged mode: when Mario captures a flaming bob-omb, Bowser gets mad and enters Enraged mode.
  - In this state:
    - A burning aura is visible around Bowser,
    - The emergency jump is no longer triggered, so Bowser's combo is not reset if Mario gets too close to him.
  - During Enraged mode, Bowser cannot be damaged by the captured bob-omb's explosions.
  - Bowser leaves the Enraged mode if he's exhausted or if the bob-omb is no longer captured.
- Changes to Bowser's attacks:
  - Shockwaves move slightly faster, but the delay between each is reduced.
  - Most attacks have slightly reduced duration/cooldown.<br>As a result, **the boss fight is shorter, but the overall difficulty stays the same**.
- Changes to flaming bob-ombs:
  - They are summoned faster, and **can now be captured during their ascending state**.
    - If Mario captures a bob-omb during that state, Bowser enters Enraged mode instantly, and all other bombs are thrown at random locations on the battlefield.
    - This reduces the duration of the summoning and throwing action, but adds a difficulty as Mario has to avoid all remaining bombs at once.

### Color palettes
- Added color palettes for Mario and (playable) Peach to the `Extras` sub-menu.
- 28 built-in palettes are available and 4 customizable ones.
- Custom palettes can be edited in the save file, under `[mario_colors]` and `[peach_colors]`.
  - Each `mario_custom` (`peach_custom`) entry consists of 6 (7) pairs of RGB values in hexadecimal form.
  - The first value of a pair is the ambient color, the second is the diffuse color.
  - For Mario, the colors are in the following order: *Cap*, *Hair*, *Skin*, *Gloves*, *Overalls*, *Shoes*.
  - For Peach, the colors are in the following order: *Skin*, *Hair*, *Dress (light tone)*, *Dress (dark tone)*, *Gloves*, *Earrings*, *Shoes*.

### Odyssey Moveset:
- Mario can turn around faster underwater when standing still.
- The water punch can be canceled.
- The water dash no longer bonks into walls if Mario is not facing them.
- The player can redirect Mario after a water ground pound jump.
- Always perform the quick ledge climb action.
- The camera turns faster underwater.
- The camera moves below Mario when he's ceil-hanging.
- Cappy's homing attack range has been increased.

### Peach:
- Wearing an improved cap power-up allows Peach to launch Perry shockwaves, even if not at max health.
- Additionally, each power-up gives a Vibe effect to shockwaves:
  - The Wing cap gives Joy effect to shockwaves.
  - The Metal cap gives Rage effect to shockwaves.
  - The Vanish cap gives Gloom effect to shockwaves.

### Sparkly Stars
- Added the `Sparkly Stars` sub-menu:
  - `Mode`: Difficulty. *Disabled*, *Normal*, or *Hard*.
  - `Assist`: When enabled, helps the player by:
    - Preventing them from pressing not allowed buttons,
    - Preventing Cappy from capturing objects if captures are not allowed,
    - Preventing Peach from activating Vibes if Vibes are not allowed,
    - Displaying the remaining number of yellow/red/blue coins to collect, shards, boxes, mushroom 1-up, flames, etc...
  - `Show Hint at Level Entry`: When enabled, displays the hint sign text at level entry when there is one.
- Reduced SSL Pink Gold Star height.

### Other:
- The big Mario head (Goddard) is now skipped for all versions. The game goes directly from the title screen to the file select screen.
- Added level variant for BITS (120+ stars only):
  - Exit BBH or VCUTM, then enter BITS to access a Vanished variant of BITS, where the level geometry and surfaces are invisible (but collision is still there).
- Merged ex-nightly and ex-alo cheats list (does not overwrite Cheater in `r96a`):
  - `Moon Jump`
  - `God Mode`
  - `Invincible Player`
  - `Super Speed`

- To play with the mods, simply extract the `.zip` archives into your `sm64ex-coop-unstable/build/us_pc/mods/` directory. Then enable `OMM (Moves)` or/and `OMM (Cappy)` before hosting.
- Important note: **Do not use `OMM (Moves)` or `OMM (Cappy)` with `Shell Rush` or `Grand Theft Mario` if your coop version is not at least `unstable 24`.**

## Version 7.0.9 (01/02/2022)

- More enemies spawn Vibe sparkles and some enemies spawn more sparkles when defeated with Perry and Vibe attacks.
- *Super Mario 64 ex-alo* (`xalo`) now uses *Super Mario 64 ex-nightly* (`smex`) save data.
- *Super Mario Star Road* (`smsr`): The player can now access the Zero Life level, but the entrance is well hidden...

## Version 7.0.2 (17/01/2022)

### OMM Builder:
- Added a fix for the `undefined reference to 'gMusicData'` error.

### Bug fixes:
- Fixed a bug where Mario could grab classic Bowser during his jump in BITFS.
- Fixed a bug where Luigi and Wario couldn't use SMO animations.

  - Increased charge duration from 2 to 3 seconds.
  - New ability: Press **(B)** while airborne to perform a powerful ground pound, similar to captured Whomp's attack.

## Version 7.0.0 (14/01/2022)

### Bug fixes:
- Fixed a bug where the red coin radar didn't show the red coins in Bowser levels.<br>Additionally, the red coin radar now indicates the red coin star when all red coins have been collected.
- Fixed a bug where Bob-ombs could explode when trying to grab them with Cappy, Tiara or Perry.
- Fixed a bug in Breezing Beach (`SM74EE`) where Mario couldn't reach the fifth star if `Moveset` was set to `Odyssey`.

### Hazy Maze Cave Captures
- **Swoop**
  - Like Boo and Hoot, Swoop can jump with **(A)** multiple times in the air.
  - Hold **(B)** to move faster.
  - Hold **(A)** when hitting a ceiling to hang on it.
- **Snufit**
  - Press **(A)** to jump, **(B)** to shoot metal balls.
  - Hold **(B)** for at least 0.5 second to lock the Snufit in place and start to rapid-fire.
- **Monty Mole**
  - Once captured, can move anywhere on the ground.
  - Press **(B)** to throw a rock.
  - Monty Mole can't jump, but holding **(A)** allows it to hide in the ground.

### Lethal Lava Land Captures
- **Small Bully/Chill Bully**
  - Moves at a moderate pace, can open doors and can jump by pressing **(A)**.
  - But when pressing **(B)**, the Bully starts to accelerate to charge like Wario's shoulder bash.<br>In this state, the Bully becomes semi-invulnerable and attacks everything it touches, but can't jump.
- **Friendly Blargg** (Render96 only)
  - Similar to the Koopa shell, moves fast and even faster when holding **(B)**.
  - However, it can't jump, and can move only on lava.
- **Enemy Blargg** (Render96 only)
  - Can't jump and can move only on lava, but invincible.
  - Press **(B)** to throw a fireball that can burn almost anything.
- **Motos** (Render96 only)
  - Motos are rather slow and their jumps (**(A)**) are low, but nothing can hurt them (except lava) and they can open doors.
  - Near an object, press **(B)** to grab it. Once grabbed, Motos can move it with ease. Press **(B)** again to throw the held object.<br>More than 50 different objects can be grabbed and throw by a captured Motos!

### Super Mario Odyssey Animations
Credits to **Sharen**, who recreated the following animations in Super Mario 64:
- Cappy vault
- Cappy throw
- Cappy up-throw
- Cappy down-throw
- Cappy spin throw
- Rainbow spin
- Default death
- Drowning
- Frozen to death
- Star dance (Moon get)
These animations can be toggled on/off with the option `Super Mario Odyssey Animations`, in the `Extras` sub-menu of the OMM menu.

### Moveset Changes:
- Mario can't capture the same object twice in a row if he left it airborne, until he lands.
- Hold **(X)** to prevent Cappy from capturing enemies, even if `Cap` is set to `Cappy - Capture`.
- Added **(Z)** and **(Z)**+**(B)** cancels for the underwater Cappy throw.
- Bob-omb capture: The third explosion doesn't destroy the Bob-omb immediately. Instead, the Bob-omb explodes and Mario is ejected only when he touches the ground.

### Other Changes:
- `Return to Castle` works now for `SMMS`, `SM74` and `SMSR`.
- Sparkly Stars hints are shown when entering a level. Some levels don't show anything, and respawning or restarting the level doesn't display the message again.
- OMM textures are precached when starting the game if `precache` is set to true (External Data/Render96 only).
- OMM texts and dialogs are loaded during start-up.<br>*Notes for Render96*:
    - Languages are supported, but only the file `AM_us.omm.json` is generated automatically. For more languages, you must provide the files yourself.
    - If the game crashes at launch, make sure the selected language is English. To do that, open `sm64config.txt` and set the `language` value to `0`.

## Version 6.1.2 (14/12/2021)

### OMM Builder:
- The `clear` command now deletes only the `build` directory.
- The `delete` command removes completely the version directory.

### Changes and fixes:
- Fixed a bug where the Boo blue coin couldn't be collected all the time with Cappy.
- Fixed a bug where the loading time of Render96 was longer than intended.
- Fixed a bug where the kickable board in WF couldn't be *attacked* by Cappy and Perry.
- The three parts of the TTM slide are now in a single area (instead of 3).

## Version 6.1.0 (11/12/2021)

### OMM Builder:
- The `star_road.patch` file is no longer needed to build *Super Mario Star Road*.
- Added *Render96 ex-alpha* repository.
- Added compatibility checks:
  - *Render96 ex-alpha*, *Super Mario 64 ex-alo* and *Super Mario Star Road* cannot be built with a version of OMM prior to 6.1.0.
  - *Super Mario 64 ex-alo*, *Super Mario 74* and *Super Mario Star Road* cannot be built with DynOS.
- Added the `DYNOS` option. When selected, download and install the latest version of DynOS with the selected repository, and copy the contents of the `custom/dynos/packs` directory to the executable directory.
- Added the `PATCHES` option. This option must be explicitly set to tell the builder to apply custom patches from the `custom/patches` directory before compiling.
- Modified the `EXT_DATA` option. This option must be explicitly set to tell the builder to compile with the flag `EXTERNAL_DATA=1`, and copy the contents of the `custom/res` directory to the executable directory.
- Added the LiveSplit auto-splitter file `omm.asl` for speedruns.

### Bug fixes:
- The star number is now hidden during the ending cutscene.
- Fixed an hitbox scaling bug on Perry.
- Fixed vanilla Bowser's shockwave interaction.

### Render96 compatibility (again):
- Besides Mario and Peach, the player can also select Luigi and Wario on the file select screen.<br>Remember that even if Luigi/Wario is selected, the player can play as him only if he has been unlocked in the chosen save file. Otherwise, the game will select Mario when entering Castle grounds.
- There are two additional ways to change the selected character in-game:
  - Through the `Odyssey Mario's Moveset` menu, option `Character`.
  - Go to the Fourth floor and enter a pipe: red pipe for Mario, green for Luigi and yellow for Wario.<br>To select Peach, enter your character's pipe (red if you play as Mario, green if Luigi or yellow if Wario).
- Each character has different properties and moves:
  - **Mario**: the most balanced character.
  - **Peach**: same properties as Mario, plus extra moves from *Super Princess Peach*. See [Version 6.0.0](https://github.com/PeachyPeachSM64/sm64ex-omm/tree/master#peach).
  - **Luigi**: runs faster, jumps higher and twirl after a back-flip, but slides on ground and moves slower in the air.
  - **Wario**: runs slower and jumps lower, but has some powerful moves from *Wario World* and gains speed faster in the air.
- Interactions with custom objects:
  - Cappy can collect Luigi keys, Wario coins and the *secret power-up* in WDW.
  - Gloom Peach can kill enemy Blarggs.
  - Rage Peach can knockback Motos.
- Cheater:<br>Most of Cheater's cheats work with OMM, but there are exceptions:
  - Cheats that have no effect when `Odyssey Moveset` is enabled:
    - `Super responsive controls`
    - `Auto wall-kicks`
  - Cheats that are completely disabled with OMM:
    - `Infinite lives`
    - `Play as`

### OMM with DynOS:
- Peach, Perry and Tiara models can now be converted into DynOS models, but they need a version of OMM >= 6.1.0 to work properly.
  - Peach's `model.inc.c` and `geo.inc.c` are in the `data/omm/peachy/peach` directory.
  - Perry's `model.inc.c` and `geo.inc.c` are in the `data/omm/peachy/perry` directory.
  - Tiara's `model.inc.c` and `geo.inc.c` are in the `data/omm/peachy/tiara` directory.
  - All textures are stored in the `omm/gfx/peach` directory.

### LiveSplit auto-splitter:
- The player no longer needs to enter their splits manually in a text file.
- To make the game read splits, save them from LiveSplit as a `splits.lss` file next to the `sm64.us.f3dex2e.exe` executable.
- See [Speedrunning](https://github.com/PeachyPeachSM64/sm64ex-omm/tree/master#speedrunning) for more details.

### Other changes:
- New Cappy cheats:
  - `Cappy Can Collect Stars`, and Bowser keys, and Sparkly stars.
  - `Play As Cappy`:
    - Press **(X)** to throw Cappy, and control him instead of Mario!
    - Move with the left stick, hold **(A)** to go up, hold **(B)** to go down.
    - The camera follows Cappy, but you can hold **(R)** to look at him from Mario's perspective.
    - Press **(X)** again or wait a few seconds to return to Mario.
- Better ceiling hanging:
  - Mario can hang on a ceiling with a jump, a double jump or a wall-jump.
  - The player no longer has to hold the **(A)** button, but has to press **(A)**, **(B)** or **(Z)** to leave the ceiling.
  - Mario moves faster, up to half his ground top speed.
- Captures are affected by the characters modifiers, but inverted:
  - This has no effect on Mario or Peach captures, but...
  - Luigi captures run slower and jump lower, but move faster in the air.
  - Wario captures run faster and jump higher, but move slower in the air.
- The following captures can now open doors:
  - Goomba
  - Koopa
  - Bob-omb
  - Spindrift

## Version 6.0.6 (20/11/2021)

### Changes and fixes:
- The `Red Coins Radar` and red coins counter are disabled if the red coins star is already collected.
- Goombas are now less likely to fall off ledges.
- Cappy:
  - Force Cappy to return to Mario during a spin throw or a flying throw if no target is found when attempting to do a homing throw.
  - The homing throw range has been increased for the flying throw, but it uses Mario's position as origin instead of Cappy's.
- Vibes:
  - Reduced the cooldown between two successive activations.
  - The player can now switch between Vibes without having to deactivate the current one first.
- `Odyssey Moveset` only:
  - Fixed glitchy ledge grabs (the ones that make Mario bonk).
  - Leaving a ledge by pressing **(Z)** still results in a soft bonk, but Mario regains control shortly after.
  - You can fire Bob-omb buddies' cannons with **(B)**.
  - Thwomp's collision changed to a cube (like Grindels), as it should be.

## Version 6.0.5 (05/11/2021)

### Bug fixes:
- Fixed a bug where spawning directly inside the JRB sunken ship activated the low visibility mode if Crystal Stars (Sparkly Stars - Hard mode) were enabled.
- Fixed a bug where Gloom Peach was sometimes not fully invincible to small flames.
- Fixed some graphical glitches on Peach and Perry with the 60 FPS interpolation.

### Changes:
- Collected red coins now display the correct number above them and play the correct sound effect (only noticeable for levels with more than 8 red coins: Veneno-Sphere, Crudelo-Sphere and Ztar Zanctuary in SM74EE).
- Additionally, the pause menu displays the number of collected red coins and the total number of red coins in the current level.
- Wooden posts now drop 5 yellow coins when fully pounded. No need to turn around them anymore.
- Added the `Red Coins Radar` in `Extras`. When enabled, it indicates the direction of the nearest red coin in the bottom-left corner of the screen.
- Added the `Show Star Number` toggle in `Extras`. When enabled, a floating number appears above every visible star to indicate which star of the current level it is.

## Version 6.0.3/6.0.4 (31/10/2021)

### Builder update:
- The builder will now ask to update if a new version is detected.

### Bug fixes (Star Road):
- Fixed a bug where Mario couldn't grab Bowser's tail.

## Version 6.0.2 (28/10/2021)

### Builder update:
- The building process now generates a `logs.txt` file, similarly to **sm64pcBuilder2**.
- Star Road can now be built at any speed without stopping.
- When running the builder, if you get the error message `"Unable to retrieve current OMM version number."`, try to turn off your anti-virus before building again.
- To install Texture packs and Music packs, place the packs `.zip` archives inside a `res` directory before running the builder.
- Updated instructions.

### Changes and fixes:
- Fixed the music cuts that could happen after collecting a star in Non-Stop mode.
- Mario can break free after some time if he got shocked airborne (Odyssey Moveset only).
- Star Road Hard Mode is now available in every version. To activate it, press **(L)** on the file select screen.

### Super Mario 74:
- Debug is no longer needed to make the game work properly.
- Puppycam, 60 FPS and External Data are now fully functional with SM74.

## Version 6.0.1 (24/10/2021)
**From now on, you no longer have to update your version of OMM yourself.**<br>**However, if the changelog mentions a *Builder update* (like this one), you have to run the following command where the builder is to update it:**<br>`git checkout .; git pull -q`

### Builder update:
- The DirectX render API is now supported, build with the `DIRECT_X` option to replace the SDL/OpenGL API.
- Added an option `reset` to reset a repository without deleting it.
- The builder is now able to detect the installed version of OMM and cleaning it if it doesn't match the latest version. You don't have to update your version of OMM yourself.

- Optimized object interactions.
- Optimized some of Peach's objects that could have potentially caused slowdowns (Rage shockwave, Joy tornados, sparkles).
- Removed unused content.

### Controls:
Controls have been redesigned to be less confusing and to prevent annoying softlocks:
- Default configuration is given by the table below:

| | Keyboard (qwerty) | Keyboard (azerty) | XBox One Controller | Switch Pro Controller |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| A Button | <kbd>L</kbd> | <kbd>L</kbd> | <kbd>**A**</kbd> | <kbd>**A**</kbd> |

- All binds have been moved and are now in the `Controls` sub-menu, and are saved inside the OMM save file.
- To reset all binds to their default values (see table above), press the `Reset Controls` button.
- If the one of the **(A)**, **(R)** or **(Start)** button has no bind, its binds are reset to default.<br>This way, the player can always access the `Controls` sub-menu and press the `Reset Controls` button.
- Additionally, the player cannot bind a keyboard key or a controller button that is already assigned to the **(A)** button.<br>If another button has the same bind as the **(A)** button, that bind is removed from that button.

### Other:
- Moved the Vibe trigger to the **(Y)** button.
- Reduced Joy flying action (**(A)** button) max duration from 6 to 5 seconds.
- Added the puppy icon for `xalo` and `smsr` when Puppycam is enabled and selected.
- Added a "Correct!" sound effect when the 'complete save file' code is input correctly on the file select screen.
- Added a failsafe to the OMM save file:
  - When saving, the game creates a back-up, then write the savefile.
  - If the savefile is missing or gets corrupted/erased, the back-up will replace it.

## Version 6.0.0 (17/10/2021)

### Bug fixes:
- Fixed a bug where blue coins dropped by Boos acted like yellow coins.
- Fixed a bug where Mario couldn't leave the JRB ship through the warp pipe if Moveset was set to Classic.
- Fixed a bug where Mario could die when capturing an object near an out of bounds area.
- Fixed a bug where Mario couldn't capture objects while climbing a ledge, holding a pole, or hanging from a ceiling.
- Fixed a bug where Mario couldn't always capture a Whomp.
- Fixed a bug where Mario could perform underwater Odyssey moves while being Metal.
- Fixed a bug where the Vanish cap wasn't working properly with Vanish cap walls.
- Fixed a bug where restarting the level didn't restart the freeze timer.

### Peach:
- Peach now has some unique moves, inspired by her moveset from *Super Princess Peach*.<br>Except for Vibes, her new moves can be used only when the option `Moveset` is set to `Odyssey`.
- **Float**:
  - Replaces the mid-air spin.
  - Hold **(A)** during a fall to hover for a short time.
- **Glide**:
  - Press and hold **(A)** after a float to open Perry and start gliding.
  - Peach can glide when caught in vertical wind to go even higher!
- **Perry**:
  - Punches and Kicks are replaced by sword-like slashes and circular attacks, increasing Peach's attack range.
  - When running, Peach can execute a double slash without losing speed by simply pressing **(B)**.
  - The increased range also acts as a grab, if possible, and occurs before the damage.
  - When Peach's health is full, every attack launches a shockwave.
- **Vibes**:
  - There are four of them: *Joy*, *Rage*, *Gloom* and *Calm*.<br>Each Vibe gives Peach additional moves and effects.
  - Vibes consume Vibe points when active and deactivate at 0.<br>Vibe points are refilled over time when no Vibe is active, but Peach can fill the Vibe gauge faster by attacking enemies with Perry or by standing inside a recovery heart.
  - When a Vibe is active, Perry's attacks always launch a shockwave, with an extra effect for each type of Vibe.
  - Like Cappy directional throws, hold a D-pad button, then press **(L)** to activate a Vibe.
    - Hold **(D-up)** for *Joy*,
    - Hold **(D-right)** for *Rage*,
    - Hold **(D-left)** for *Gloom*,
    - Hold **(D-down)** for *Calm*.
  - However, there are some restrictions:
    - While a Vibe is active, Peach cannot grab or use caps. Also, activating a Vibe cancels the current cap power-up.
	- Captures still occur, but they deactivate Vibes, and Vibes cannot be used while possessing an enemy.
	- Vibes cannot stack. The active Vibe must be deactivated first to be able to use another one.
	- Vibes cannot be activated during an intangible or invulnerable state, such as taking damage or being knockbacked.
	- Vibes cannot be used underwater, and deactivate if Peach touches water, except *Calm*.
  - *Joy*:<br>Peach spins endlessly, creating a tornado around her.<br>In that state, she can only move, fly by holding **(A)** or attack by pressing **(B)**.<br>The tornado can repel enemies, attract nearby coins and lifts Peach upwards. As a result, she never makes direct contact with the floor, making her invulnerable to lava and quicksand.
    - Perry attacks are replaced by gusts. Like the tornado, they can attract coins, but damage enemies instead of simply repelling them.
	- Her happiness is such that the background music becomes faster and her voice gets higher.
  - *Rage*:<br>Peach becomes furious, making her stronger.<br>She is surrounded by a burning aura that damages enemies on contact, her ground pounds emit a fire shockwave on landing, can destroy some solid objects and defeat most of bosses in a single hit, but she's also slower and her jumps are lower.
	- Perry attacks are also stronger and launch larger, but slower fiery shockwaves.
	- Because of her menacing stance, the background music is slower and her voice is deeper.
  - *Gloom*:<br>Peach is so sad she can't stop crying...<br>She moves faster, jumps higher and her tears can extinguish most of the flames.<br>She can also run on slopes and on water.
    - Perry attacks produce blue shockwaves. They move faster and go through enemies, but are smaller than regular ones.
	- Peach's sadness slows down the music and her voice.
  - *Calm*:<br>Peach regenerates herself with positive thoughts.<br>She regains health and O2 over time, and becomes immune to the effects of frozen water.<br>*Calm* cannot be used if Peach's health and O2 are already at max.
    - Perry attacks release green shockwaves that heal Peach if they damage an enemy.
	- Peach's positivity makes the music and her voice slightly pitched up.

### Sparkly Stars:
- Crystal Stars have been redesigned.<br>They are now called Sparkly Stars, and come with two different versions, the Pink Gold Stars and the (new) Crystal Stars.
- **Pink Gold Stars**:
  - Correspond to the *Normal* difficulty.
  - Collecting them all is the condition to unlock Peach.
  - To unlock this mode, the player needs 120 Power Stars and defeat Bowser 3.
  - Each Star is similar to the old *Crystal Stars Easy mode*, with some changes:
    - Lethal Lava Land: The lava floor stops before the top, where the 5th Power star is.
	- Shifting Sand Land: The Star is now located above the top of the pyramid, and needs a crazy box to be reached.
	- Dire Dire Docks: The Star is now located above the Bowser door in the second area.
	- Tiny-Huge Island: The Star is now in Tiny Island, and needs a stack of 10 mini-goombas.
	- Castle Inside/Castle Upstairs: Star shards are easier to locate and collect.
	- Bowser 4: No more life-up and infinite Flaming Bob-omb, but the difficulty of this fight has been lowered down.
- **Crystal Stars**:
  - Correspond to the *Hard* difficulty.
  - Collecting them all unlocks the `Crystal Stars Reward` option.
  - To unlock this mode, the player must have completed the Sparkly Stars *Normal* difficulty, i.e. collected all 30 Pink Gold Stars and unlocked Peach.
  - The overall difficulty is above the old *Crystal Stars Normal mode*:
    - Whomp Fortress: The Star is now located under the fortress, and the player has only 1 minute and 50 seconds to spawn and collect it.
	- Jolly Roger Bay: The field of view is greatly reduced.
	- Cool, Cool Mountain: The Star is now located high above the mountaintop, and needs a spindrift to be reached.
	- Big Boo's Haunt: The player has only 2 minutes and 15 seconds to spawn and collect the Star.
	- Hazy Maze Cave: The player must extinguish all red flames in under 3 minutes.
	- Lethal Lava Land: The Star shards are harder to collect, and the lava rises faster.

### Captures and Objects:

  - Captures progressively accelerate and decelerate instead of reaching instantly max or min speed.
  - Same handling system as Mario (low speed = tight turn, high speed = large turn).

  - First person mode allows a full 360 degrees turn, and extends the pitch limit to 89 degrees (almost vertical).
  - For levels with multiple rooms (Big Boo's Haunt, Hazy Maze Cave), the rendered room is the one where the camera is pointing at, not only Mario's room.
  - Bowser fights have now a proper OMM camera mode.
- Save files:
  - OMM has now its proper save file and file format.
  - This format is similar to `TEXT_SAVES`, but it stores all save data of every version of the game in one single file, as well as settings related to OMM and Sparkly Stars save data.
  - It also includes a cheat to instantly complete a save file and unlock Peach: On the file select screen, move the cursor to a save file button, then press the following buttons in that order:<br>**(C-up)**, **(C-up)**, **(C-down)**, **(C-down)**, **(C-left)**, **(C-right)**, **(C-left)**, **(C-right)**, **(Z)**, **(R)**, **(A)**.

  - New Bowser quotes!

    - **(B)**: Play a random song.
    - **(A)** + **(B)**: Restore the BBH music.
- Crazy box:
  - Constantly bounces, even if not moving.

### Speedrun:
Added a LiveSplit Auto-Splitter script: `omm.4.1.2.asl`.<br>If you don't use LiveSplit or prefer manual splits, ignore this.<br>If you don't know how yo use LiveSplit scripts, please read the LiveSplit documentation.
- Features:
  - This script does all the splits for you on OMM runs.
  - Starts when a file is selected.
  - Splits after catching some stars (see below).
  - Stops when the Grand Star is collected.
  - Resets when the `Return to Main Menu` option is selected, or after the cake ending scene.
- Instructions:
  - Open `omm.4.1.2.asl` in a text editor.

  - For instance, if your splits are: BOB (5), WF (8), JRB (12)<br>Write: `vars.starSplits = new byte[] { 5, 8, 12 };`
  - For 70 star runs, the array must end with 70
  - For 120 star runs, the array must end with 120

### OMM Bowser fights:
- General:
  - The overall difficulty has been reduced (most notably OMM Bowser 3).
  - Possessed flaming bob-omb can now withstand any of Bowser's fire attacks once.<br>It leaves a burn smoke above it, to show the player it got hit.<br>The second time it is damaged, it explodes and ejects Mario, as usual.
- Attacks:
  - The rain of fire (OMM Bowser 3 fight) has been removed.
  - The homing fire ball has been replaced by a regular fire ball, but...<br>If Mario is on ground, Bowser will try to predict his movement.<br>If Mario is airborne, Bowser will shoot a faster fire ball directly at him.<br>The fire ball leaves a burning trail on the ground, but quickly disappears.
- Graphics:
  - Added unique graphics for each one of OMM Bowser's attacks.
  - Attacks have been optimized to reduce at most any lag or slowdown.
  - Delays have been reduced and animations have been shortened to reduce at most the waiting time between actions.

  - Hold **(B)** to brake and rotate in place. Release **(B)** to start flying again.
  - Duration has been increased from 45 to 60 seconds.
- Improved Vanish cap:
  - Inspired by the Vanish cap render, it allows Mario to move through grids and thin walls.
  - When Mario touches such a wall, he instantly vanishes only to reappear on the other side, while a teleport sound effect is played.
  - As long as Mario wears the Vanish cap, his gravity is reduced, allowing him to jump higher and fall slower, and Cappy ignores wall and ceiling collisions when thrown.
  - Duration has been increased from 20 to 40 seconds.
- Improved Metal cap:
  - Inspired by the in-game description itself, it allows Mario to be truly and fully invincible.
  - Nothing can damage or knockback Metal Mario. He's also immune to fall damage.
  - He's too heavy to be grabbed by Chuckyas, King Bob-omb or Heave-hos.
  - He's resistant to strong winds and water currents.
  - He can perfectly walk on lava and quicksands without being slowed down.

  - The circular platform still turns into a star-shaped platform after the second hit.
  - OMM Bowser 3 is way harder than OMM Bowser 2 and vanilla Bowser 3, but fits more as a final boss.

### Speedrun Rules update:
- Because OMM Bowser fights are longer (and mandatory) than vanilla Bowser fights, submitted runs of OMM prior to this version (4.1.0) are now obsolete and invalid.
- Because Non-Stop mode and OMM Bowser fights are now fully implemented, submitted runs of OMM starting from this version (4.1.0) will always be valid, no matter the future updates of this mod.
- Because `Restart level` and `Exit level` are options from the pause menu, the usage of any DynOS option is now forbidden. Opening the DynOS menu during a run makes it invalid.

- Added minimum velocity required to start rolling out of a long jump/air dive.
- If the player hold **(Z)** out of a long jump or an air dive, Mario will instantly roll as he touches the ground, preventing any fall damage.
- Holding **(Z)** while rolling makes Mario roll longer and further.
- Collecting a star fills the O2 meter and restores Mario's health (Non-Stop mode only).

- There is a small chance after a death for a lost coin to turn into a moneybag.
- Increased Goomba stack max count to 10 Goombas.
- Added the Leave Ending Screen patch by GateGuy, and delayed the `Thank you so much` voice line to not overlap with the credits music.
- As `Exit level` is now a DynOS feature, selecting `Exit course` on the pause screen brings Mario back again to the center of the Castle.
- HUD:
  - Outside the Bowser fights, the Castle and when the game is not paused, the star counter is replaced by 7 star icons,
    representing the 6 consecutive acts of a course and the 100 coins star.

- Snowman
  - Its head is capturable only before being reunited with its body.
  - Its body can be captured on its pedestal, at the top of the mountain.
  - Snowman's body can move with the Left Stick, but cannot jump.<br>It gets bigger and faster as it rolls and defeats most of enemies on contact, but breaks and ejects Mario if it takes damage or lands from too high.

### Bonus:
- Toad is now capturable, and does not eject Mario after he finishes talking:
  - Walk with the Left Stick, hold **(B)** to run, press **(A)** to jump, and interact with doors to open them.
  - And because Peach gave him the Castle master key, he can open Star doors without the need of Power Stars, but can't open the doors locked by Bowser.

    - The Snowman's body always spawns separated from its head, looking for Mario to escort him.
  - Big Boo's Haunt:

- Fixed a bug that made Mario start any savefile with only 4 segments of health if SMO-Health was deactivated
- Fixed a bug that prevented the SM64 power meter from being displayed if SMO-Health was deactivated
- Fixed a bug that drew Cappy's eyes over wings on Render96 Mario's wing cap

## Version 3.0.0 (16/10/2020)

### Changes and fixes:
- Better ground/air movement
  - To mimic Odyssey's mechanics, Mario's face yaw (his forward direction) is more or less responsive to change depending on his forward velocity.<br>If he's standing still (horizontally), he can quickly change direction, grounded and airborne. But the faster he is, the harder he's to control.
  - Any Cappy throw will instantly change Mario's direction, regardless of his forward speed.
  - Furthermore, some actions set at their end Mario's direction to the joystick direction.
- Better wall-slide
  - Mario starts wall-sliding only if he's falling, so a wall slide will never interrupt a jump.
  - Mario progressively slides on the wall, instead of falling at a constant speed.
  - Mario cannot grab the same wall or another wall with a similar angle after a wall jump, until he touches the ground or water.
  - Mario bonks if he was long-jumping or air diving.
  - Mario's wall jump direction follows the reflection angle, but can be altered by the left stick while wall-jumping.
- Improved wall/floor/ceiling collision system
  - Wall collision:
    - Increased the search radius from 1 to 9 cells, and removed the radius limit.
    - Collisions are not checked anymore for PUs, as they are treated as out of bounds.
  - Ceiling collision:
    - Always return the lowest ceiling found, instead of the first one (no more ceiling-cucking).
    - Collisions are not checked anymore for PUs, as they are treated as out of bounds.
  - Floor collision:
    - Five points are checked instead of one for each floor, to prevent objects from going through small gaps.<br>This fix applies only for flat and pseudo-flat floors, to prevent Mario from walking mid-air while moving on steep floors (SSL pillars).
    - Always return the highest floor found, instead of the first one (no more floor-cucking).
    - Collisions are not checked anymore for PUs, as they are treated as out of bounds.
  - Water level and Gas level:
    - Changed < to <=, removing edge-case bugs (z = -58).
  - Mario Ground step:
    - Increased the number of sub-steps from 4 to 16.
    - Walls are more resistant to hyper-speed glitches (BLJ).
  - Mario Air step:
    - Increased the number of sub-steps from 4 to 16.
    - Fixed the glitchy ledge grab (no more WF cannon-less).
    - Prevents Mario from going through thin floors with enough speed.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented Mario from jumping from a raising platform.
  - Mario Water step:
    - Increased the number of sub-steps from 1 to 16.
    - Better steep floors and ceilings collision.
    - Mario can't move more than he should, removing all up/downwarps.
- Freezing effect in cold water
  - Freezing water no longer drains more O2, but progressively freezes Mario.
  - The freezing effect intensifies during 5 seconds, after that Mario takes damage every 5 seconds.
  - The freezing timer decreases slowly while airborne, but decreases quickly when Mario is on ground.

### Mario's Moveset:
- More Odyssey-style roll
  - Start rolling by pressing **(Z)** and **(B)**, then keep pressing **(B)** to gain speed. Press **(A)** to stop the roll and do a long-jump.<br>Mario goes full speed if he starts a roll after a ground pound land or a spin pound land.<br>Mario can slightly change his direction with the control stick while rolling.
  - Mario slowly decelerates on flat/pseudo-flat ground. For reference, the first bridge of BoB is the limit of what is a pseudo-flat ground (< 20°).<br>Mario rapidly loses speed and handling when moving uphill, but goes even faster when moving downhill on a steep slope or a slide.<br>He comes to a full stop and bonks when touching a wall.<br>The roll carries on airborne, but is harder to control, and continues when Mario comes back to the ground.
- Underwater ground pound jump
  - When Mario touches the floor underwater after a ground pound, immediately press **(A)** to do a high jump.
- Improved water dash
  - Mario can move in all directions, and keep dashing as long as **(B)** is held, but this move drains O2 really fast.
- Spin actions
  - Do a full circle with the left stick to start spinning.
  - While Mario is spinning, press **(A)** to do a spin jump. This jump is the highest one Mario can do, even higher than a triple jump.
  - Do a full circle while airborne to do an air spin. Mario stops falling for a few moment while performing an air spin.
  - Press **(Z)** to turn Mario's ground pound into a spin pound if he's spinning or twirling in the air.
  - Cappy spin throws are now triggered by spin + **(X)** instead of **(X)** + **(A)**.
- Animations
  - Ground pound jump: more accurate to Odyssey.
  - Roll: better rolling animation.
  - Jump kick: Mario will do a little spin instead of a jump kick if Cappy is not on his head.
  
### Super Metal Mario:
- Underwater Metal Mario's moveset has been greatly enhanced. Here is the list of the moves he can perform:<br>Idle, Walk, Crouch, Crawl, Jump, Double jump, Triple jump, Backflip, Sideflip, Long Jump, Freefall, Wall slide, Wall jump, Punch (all 3 variants), Jump kick, Dive, Ground pound, Ground pound jump, Cappy throws, Cappy jump, and all Spin actions.
- The Metal cap duration has been increased from 20 to 30 seconds.
- Metal Mario is now truly invincible, as he cannot die as long as he's wearing his metal cap.<br>Note that he's still vulnerable to instant death effects, such as quicksand or death barrier.
  
### Star Collection Mode:
- In main courses, Mario does not leave the course after collecting a star.<br>Instead, he does a victory dance while the star jingle is playing, and, similarly to Odyssey, a text box appears below him, showing the message *YOU GOT A STAR* with the name of the course and the star he got.
- The game auto-saves after collecting a star. Furthermore, it will ask the player if he wants to leave the course after he collects all the available stars (100 coins star included).
- As long as Star Collection Mode is active, the option `Exit course` always brings Mario back in front of the course painting instead of the center of the Castle. This works for every stage, not only the 15 main courses.
- Dying drops Mario at the beginning of the course again, instead of returning to the Castle.<br>The death sequences have been edited to look more Odyssey-like.<br>There are seven of them: regular, drowning, falling, frozen, eaten by Bubba, quicksanded, squished.
- When Mario dies, the course is completely reset and he loses all his coins, but (at most) 20 of them drop on the floor and can be collected again after his death. This makes a death less frustrating and punishing, specifically when trying to collect a 100 coins star. This works for every stage, not only the 15 main courses.
  
### Odyssey Options Menu:
- DynOS v0.4 is included with this patch. You don't need to patch it.
- Custom options
  - `Mario's Moveset` can be set to `Classic` or `Odyssey`.
  - `Cappy's Behavior` can be set to `Disabled`, `No Capture` or `Capture`
  - `Cappy Throw Button` allows you to bind your keys/buttons used to throw Cappy.
  - `Health System` can be set to `Classic` (SM64), `3-Health` (Odyssey normal mode) or `6-Health` (Odyssey assist mode).
  - `Star Collection` can be set to `Classic` or `Non-Stop`.
  - `Underwater Metal Mario` can be set to `Classic` or `Super`.
  
### Last but not least, Cappy:
- Cappy now has eyes, but only with SM64 Mario, HD Mario, Render96 Mario and Render96 Luigi. They show up with regular Mario, Vanish-cap Mario and Winged-cap Mario, but not Metal Mario.

## Version 2.0.2 (14/09/2020)

### Changes and fixes:
- Fixed a crash that happened when throwing Cappy 64 times in a row, without grabbing it or bouncing on it.
- Fixed a crash that happened when Cappy was out while Mario was teleporting through invisible warps.
- Removed Time Trials and Ghost Race from SMO, added it as a separate patch, Time Trials v2.0.
- Added SMO Options Menu as a separate `.txt` file, working with DynOS v0.2.<br>With DynOS patched, add the `.txt` file to your `res` folder.<br>Without DynOS patched, the default configuration used by the game is the following:
  - Mario's Odyssey moveset is enabled
  - Cappy throw is bound to the button 2 on a controller (corresponds to **(X)** button on XBox One controllers), or **[X]** key on keyboard
  - Cappy's behavior is set to `Capture`
  - Mario uses the 3-Health system from Odyssey
- Cappy now unloads if Mario has his cap in his hand or if he loses his cap (ukiki, big snowman, fwoosh).

## Version 2.0.1 (10/09/2020)

### Changes and fixes:
- Time Trials
  - Fixed a bug when generated ghost data would produce abnormally large .txt files under certain circumstances.<br>The new time trials data files use a different file format, so older files are incompatible with 2.0.1.
  
## Version 2.0.0 (08/09/2020)

### Changes and fixes:
- Mario's moveset
  - Fixed a wall slide glitch and the animation.
  - The moves Water plunge and Water dash now ignore water currents, but drains more O2.
  - While flying with the Wing cap, press **(X)** + **(A)** to make Cappy fly around Mario.
  - All the basic cheats are usable + `Super Responsive` works also airborne if SMO Mario is enabled.
- Captures
  - Increased Possessed-Goomba's hitbox height.<br>Now each Goomba inside the stack has its feet on the previous Goomba's head, instead of clipping through it.
  - Reduced the number of Possessed-Bobomb explosions to 3, but increased the explosion radius.<br>After each explosion, the bobomb bloats up and the third one destroys it.
  - Small boxes are now destructible by strong attacks, such as Possessed-Bobomb explosion and Possessed-Chomp bite.
  - Possessed-Koopa stays in his shell when **(B)** is held (even if he's jumping or not moving).
  - Mario is ejected from his possession if he's squished and doesn't take additional damage, but he still takes damage from a regular squish like the tox boxes' one in SSL.
- System
  - SMO Health options are now `Disabled`, `3-Health` (Odyssey default), `6-Health` (Odyssey Assist mode)
  - `SMO Mario`, `Cappy Capture` and `SMO 3-Health` are enabled by default
  - The SMO sound effects should play correctly in `External Resources` mode if they are included in a resource pack.<br>To insert SMO sounds in your `texture/sound pack`, patch the `00.json` and `00_sound_player.s` files.<br>Copy the sound folder inside your sm64 repo folder, and hit compile.<br>When done, grabs the `bank_sets`, `sequences.bin`, `sound_data.ctl` and `sound_data.tbl` files generated and add them in a `sound` folder to your pack.
- Patches
  - Included the `Exit to main menu` code (credits to Adya for the original patch).<br>To access it, pause the game, press **(R)** and select `Go Back to Main Menu`.
  - Included the `Return to Title after Ending` code (credits to GateGuy for the original patch).<br>After the Cake ending screen, press **(A)** to return to the main menu.
    
### New stuff:
- Time Trials
  - Included an enhanced version of the `Time Trials` code (credits to GateGuy for the original patch).<br>Time Trials doesn't require `Text Saves` anymore. Times are now saved on a separate `.txt` file inside your save folder.
  - The best recorded times for each course can be seen when opening the pause menu inside the Castle walls.<br>In the act selection menu, the best time is displayed above the selected star.
  - Additionally, the HUD shows a flashing *HI SCORE* if the player sets a new record when collecting a star or a key.
- Ghost Race
  - When establishing a new record, the path Mario took from the level entry to the star is saved as Ghost data.<br>Selecting this star on the act selection menu again will make Cosmic Mario spawn, allowing the player to `race` against his best time.
  - A ghost can be saved for every act of every course of the game, including the 3 Bowser fights, for a total of 118 ghosts per save file.
- Options
  - Time Trials has its own sub-menu, located below `Super Mario Odyssey`.
    - `Time Trials` can be enabled or disabled.
    - `Time Trial Ghost` can be set to `Show` or `Hide`.
  - As some stars are not selectable via the act selection menu, the following options specifies the Ghost to load when entering a level:
    - `Main Courses Ghost` can be set to `Selected Act Star` or `100 Coins Star`.
    - `Bowser Courses Ghost` can be set to `Bowser Fight` or `Red Coins Star`.
    - `PSS Ghost` can be set to `Star 1` or `Star 2`.
  - By default, the TT settings are `Enabled`, `Show`, `Selected Act Star`, `Bowser Fight` and `Star 1`.
  
### Whomp Fortress Captures:
These include Bullet Bill, Hoot, Whomp and Whomp King.
- Bullet Bill
  - The player enters the wing-cap flying Mario camera mode, and controls the Bullet with the left stick.
  - The Bullet Bill always moves at a constant speed, and nothing can slow it down. Hold **(B)** to go faster.
  - But colliding with a wall or a ceiling make the Bullet Bill explode, and Mario is ejected from it.<br>If **(B)** was held, it produces a powerful blast that can destroy enemies and some structures (the wall behind the Tower, the kickable board and both of the cannon walls).
  - Unlike Odyssey, the Bullet Bill doesn't self-destruct after a specific amount of time, allowing the player to freely move around the map.
- Hoot
  - This lil' bird is controllable like a regular enemy, but has infinite jumps and floats in the air.
  - Keep pressing **(A)** to flap Hoot's wings, making him go up.
  - Release **(A)** to float and slowly regain the ground.
- Whomp
  - Whomp is not really fast, and does not jump really high with **(A)**, but he's strong.
  - Press **(B)** to start a Body slam. When touching the ground, it emits a powerful shockwave that can eliminate most of the enemies.<br>The initial impact can even destroy some walls and boxes, and other Whomps, if you land on their back.
  - His back and the water seem to be his only weaknesses.
- Whomp King
  - First you try to step on him, now you want to capture it. It makes him so mad.
    
## Version 1.5.8 (28/08/2020)

### Hotfixes:
- SMO HUD
  - Hide the coin counter inside the castle walls
  - Properly shows collected keys (below star count) with the SGI v1.4.2 pack

## Version 1.5.7 (27/08/2020)

### Changes and fixes:
- Roll speed has been slightly reduced.
- Mario has more air control: he can turn progressively while airborne, and turns instantly when throwing Cappy.
- Fall height has been increased and Mario no longer takes fall damage, but he's unable to move for 1.5 second when landing from a high place.
- Grounded Mario's controls are more responsive (similar but not as extreme as `Super-responsive controls` cheat).
- Cappy returns to Mario after 4 seconds instead of vanishing instantly. Same when he hits an attackable enemy (bully, skeeter...).
- Mario can throw Cappy after a Cappy jump, but the latter is intangible for him (like in Odyssey).
- Mostly code refactoring (for compatibility purposes).

### New stuff:
- The 3-health system from Odyssey has been implemented.
  - Every damage Mario takes reduces his health points by 1.<br>Collecting 10 coins or touching a spinning heart recovers 1 health.<br>Burn damage is applied only on frame 1, but Mario still does his burning animation.
  - Mario can still die, but can't game-over, as this system provides him infinite lives.
  - Collecting a 1-up mushroom fully heals Mario and increases his max health points from 3 to 6.<br>But if he falls under 3 health, he can't get back to 6 health until he collects a 1-up mushroom again.
  - The life-up effect is carried through levels.
- The HUD has been updated to match with this system.
  - The lives counter is replaced by the star counter, and the coin counter is moved below the star one.<br>Underwater, the O2 level is shown below the coin counter.
  - On the top-right now stands the health gauge from Odyssey.
  - The timer (displayed during PSS or Koopa the Quick race) is moved to the bottom-right.
- The SMO options sub-menu now has three categories.
  - You can enable or disable SMO Mario's moveset anytime.<br>SMO Mario's moveset includes new moves, wall slide, air control, responsive ground control, fall height and fall damage changes.
  - You can choose Cappy's mode from `Disabled`, `No Capture` or `Capture`.<br>This way, Cappy (and captures) can be used even if SMO Mario's moveset is disabled.
  - You can enable or disable the SMO health system.<br>Enabling sets Mario's HP from 0 to 3, according to SM64 Mario's current health, even if it's full. Mario can only get to 6 HP if he collects a 1-up mushroom.<br>Disabling makes Mario lose his life-up effect.
- Last, but not least, 3 sound effects from Odyssey have been added.
  - The sound when Mario collects a Life-Up heart is played when collecting a 1-up mushroom.
  - The sound when Mario takes damage.
  - The sound when Mario regains 1 health point.

## Version 1.4.2 (22/08/2020)

### Changes and fixes:
- Now compatible with SGI v1.4.2 (Credits to DorfDork).

## Version 1.0.1 (14/08/2020)

### Changes and fixes:
- Fixed a crash that occured when trying to capture an enemy, if a custom sound pack was loaded.

## Version 1.0.0 (12/08/2020)

### Changes and fixes:
- Mario takes off his cap when Cappy is thrown. (Thanks to s4ys)
- Mario's wall slide is faster.
- Metal Mario can punch and jump kick under water.
- Mario turns while throwing Cappy, making him able to change direction airborne.
- Cappy's throw is now bound to a new button (not the B button anymore).<br>You'll have to go to the Options menu, Controls sub-menu and bind keys for the `X button`.
- Cappy can be thrown in a way that it orbits around Mario by pressing **(X)** and **(A)** simultaneously.
- A sub-menu `Super Mario Odyssey` is available in the Options menu.<br>You can choose from here Mario's moveset and if you want to enable or disable Cappy.<br>By default, Mario's moveset is set to `64 moveset` and Cappy is disabled.
- Two new cheats have been added to the *secret* Cheats sub-menu:<br>`Unlimited Cappy jumps` and `Cappy stays forever`. (Thanks to s4ys for the idea)

### New stuff:
You wanted it, here it is. Now, Mario can capture and possess his enemies! (Well, currently, a few ones)
- In the `Super Mario Odyssey` sub-menu, set Cappy to `Capture`.<br>Throw Cappy to an enemy, and it will try to possess it. Each enemy has a unique way to move and act.<br>For this version, only the enemies present in Bob-omb Battlefield are capturable.<br>This includes Goomba, Koopa, Bob-omb, Bob-omb buddy, Bob-omb King and Chain Chomp.<br>Press **(Z)** while possessing an enemy to leave it. Mario automatically leaves his possession if he takes damage.
- Goomba
  - This little boy can walk, run by holding **(B)** and jump by pressing **(A)**.
  - If you jump on another goomba, you can create a Goomba stack.<br>Jump on other ones to make your stack grow. (with a limit of 8 Goombas)
- Koopa (shelled)
  - This one can walk, jump by pressing **(A)**, and shell-slide by holding **(B)**.
  - Shell-sliding has the same properties as Mario while he rides a shell: knockback enemies, travel on lava...
  - Koopa the Quick is not capturable.
- Koopa (unshelled)
  - The other one can't shell-slide, but can run (for his life).
  - He can get his shell back if he touches it.
- Bob-omb
  - Bob-omb can't run, but launches a destructive explosion when pressing **(B)**.
  - His explosion destroys enemies and brick blocks.
- Bob-omb buddy
  - Mario can't move him around, but reads his dialog without having to talk to him.
  - Mario is automatically ejected when the dialog ends.
  - The cannon variant is also capturable.
- Bob-omb king
  - Just try to capture him.
- Chain chomp
  - While possessing Chain chomp, Mario can move, do big hops by holding **(A)** and perform a bite attack by pressing **(B)**.
  - He's restricted to his chain attached to the wooden post, but can break free if he tries to bite while his chain is fully stretched.
  - When freed, this massive iron ball is invulnerable and knockbacks enemies on contact, and can even break brick blocks and some walls by biting them.
  - Note: Freed chain chomp has a new behavior when Mario leaves it: he will start to chase Mario if he is too close to him.

## Version 0.11.0 (27/07/2020)

### Changes and fixes:
- Mario wall-slides automatically when touching a wall, making wall jumps easier.<br>Additionally, press **(Z)** on a wall to stop wall-sliding.
- Breathing underwater does not drain Mario's power anymore.<br>He has now a separate oxygen meter, visible under Mario's lives counter.

### New actions:
- On the ground, press **(Z)** + **(B)** to do a roll. Press **(Z)** + **(B)** again to keep rolling.
- In the air, press **(Z)** to start a ground pound, then press **(B)** before impact to do an air dive.
- After landing from a ground pound, press **(A)** to do a high jump, or **(Z)** to start rolling.
- Underwater, press **(Z)** to plunge, **(Z)** + **(B)** to do a water dash.<br>These actions make Mario move really fast, but they drain his oxygen meter.

### Cap actions:
- On the ground, in the air or underwater, press **(B)** to throw Mario's cap in front of him.<br>His cap collects coins and secrets and attacks enemies like Goombas or Koopas.
- Touch the cap to bounce on it. If Mario touches it from the ground, he can throw it once more in the air.<br>Underwater, Mario can't interact with his cap, but Metal Mario can.
- For the moment, there is no capture mechanic. Instead, the cap gives to Mario any grabbable object it encounters on its path (Bob-ombs, corkboxes, lil' penguin...)
